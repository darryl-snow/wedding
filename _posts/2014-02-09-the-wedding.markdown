![Us with our marriage papers]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/darrylandhuojie.jpg)

We met at the China Meteorological Administration, where we both used to work. Our first date was on the 17<sup>th</sup> of January, 2010; we went skiing. We followed up with some more dates - we went to see Avatar 3 times because Huojie kept falling asleep at the beginning and missing the whole thing. In May that year we got a dog together, Lady. After lots more dates and holidays together, we signed marriage papers on the 1<sup>st</sup> of February, 2011. Darryl officially proposed on the banks of the River Ganges on Huojie's birthday on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of November, 2013.

### The Best People

Guy Benjamin Wescott Taylor is the best man. Darryl and Guy have been friends ever since guy knocked on Darryl's door at university on the 24th of September 2001, to invite him out for birthday drinks, and was happy to see that Darryl was wearing a T-shirt that said "Chicks dig unix" on it. It was again in celebration of Guy's birthday a few years later that Darryl came to China, and stayed.

The bridesmaid is a childhood friend of Huojie's, 阿丽, who still lives in Kunming and works as a teacher.

### Kunming

Kunming is the capital of Yunnan province in SouthWestern China. Yunnan province is famous for its ethnic diversity, comfortable climate, traditional towns and villages, and beautiful scenery. 

> The food features lots of preserved meats, chili, sour pickles, wild mushrooms, and, uniquely in China, goat cheese (very similar to Haloumi). There are also lots of familiar ingredients to SouthEast Asia, like tamarind, lemongrass, and coconut. Famous dishes include 米线 (rice noodles, similar to Udon noodles, most often served in a soup but also served cold and mixed with corriander and chili - this will be on our wedding menu), 气锅鸡 (chicken steamed in its own juice), 乳扇 (thin layers of dried goat cheese, sprinkled with either salt or sugar), 石板豆腐 (fermented tofu, deep fried and served with a sauce made from&hellip; fermented tofu).

Kunming is known as the "Spring City", with comfortable weather throughout the year - daytime temperatures remain between 20 and 32 degrees all year round. The weather in May should be hot and dry. The city itself is very clean and developed, with lots of palm trees. There aren't too many cars and the air is relatively clean. In terms of size it's a fairly small city with a population of around 3 million, making it quite easy to get around. I can pretty much guarantee the weather on the day will be hot and sunny.

The airport is about an hour out of town. During the day there is a subway line into the city centre but after 2230 you'll have to take a taxi for around [¥100](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=100&From=CNY&To=GBP "See how much this is in £").

## The Wedding Day

Here's what will happen:

* **10:00 - To the Bride's house**

  The bride is locked away in her bedroom with her bridesmaids. She has to give face to her parents by outwardly showing that she doesn't want to leave them by refusing to come out. The groom's mission is to try and coax her out by lighting fireworks outside, breaking down doors and windows, bribing family members with cash, and by completing a gauntlet of humiliating tasks determined by the bridesmaids. He will be accompanied by everyone but must complete he mission alone. Once inside the bride's bedroom, however, the mission is not over, for she has hidden her shoes and cannot leave the house without them!
* **11:00 - To the Groom's house**

  Now that the bride has been retrieved, she must be taken to the Groom's house (parents' hotel suite) for displays of fileal piety. Tea & porridge ceremonies ensue.
* **12:00 - Lunch**

  A short break for some eating and drinking to prepare for the day ahead. Probably in a restaurant.
* **14:00 - To the venue**

  Everyone makes their way to the wedding venue - some people will have cars but most people will have to take taxis (about [¥50](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=50&From=CNY&To=GBP "See how much this is in £")). There will be time to walk around, take photos, or even visit the minorities village theme park over the road. The bride and groom will prepare themselves and take photos with the parents, groomsmen, and bridesmaids.
* **16:00 - The ceremony**

  This will take place outside - if it's too sunny there will be umbrellas provided. The bride and groom will walk the aisle and take vows given by the best man.
* **17:00 - Drinks**

  A bit of time for drinks and nibbles while waiting for guests to arrive and deliver their red envelopes. We will have a small putting green available to us, if anyone's interested?
* **18:00 - Dinner**

  Guests arrive (around 150 in total), present their red envelopes and then begin to feast. Each table will seat 10 people with no pre-arranged seating arrangement. There will be around 20 dishes, featuring all the most delicious animals as well as a couple of vegetables, and a few bottles of red wine, rice wine, and soft drinks on each table. There should also be a couple of kegs of home-brew somewhere near the top table. During or after the meal there will be speeches from the groom, the bride, the parents, and the best man.
* **20:00 - KTV?**

### Things to do in and around Kunming

If you're staying in Kunming or a while, the city has some nice parks and temples to visit, as well as the stone forrest, and the minorities theme park. Just outside of town is the infamous midget village, and then further away you can reach the following attractions Yunnan via bus or plane:

* **Dali 大理**

  A chilled-out, walled Ming-dynasty town in the mountains about 4 hours away from Kunming. It's got fresh air, traditional architecture, and some nice hippy bars where old ladies will try to sell you cannabis. Lots of little gift shorts and traditional minority craftware available, and it's a good area for trekking. Altitude about 2000m.

* **Lijiang 丽江**

  Extremely beautiful Ming-dynasty town (and UNESCO world heritage site) in Western Yunnan, around 4000m above sea level. It's filled with cobbled streets and canals, trendy bars, and has a very ethnic feel from the minority population. It can get very busy with tourists but still worth a visit. There are lots of other nearby attractions like 1000 Turtle mountain, Jade Dragon Snow mountain, and Tiger Leaping Gorge.

* **Tiger Leaping Gorge 虎跳峡**

  A few hours from Lijiang is an enormous gorge carved out by the Yangtze. One on side of the gorge a mountain stands at 6000m. Spend 3 days trecking past traditional farming villages on the other side for breath-taking views.

* **Shangrila 香格里拉**

  Recently renamed to attract tourists, this is a traditional Tibetan town on the edge of the Tibetan plateau. Go there if you want a feel for Tibet without the hassle of the permits and tour guides. There are temples and monasteries, quaint taverns, and clean air. Can be cold though, and it's very high up! Be aware that in January this year most of the town burnt down so it might not be in it's full glory, but still might be a nice place to visit for a taste of Tibetan culture.

* **XiShuangBanNa 西双版纳**

  If Tibet sounds too cold, head South, where China meets Laos and Thailand. The architecture and food is notably different. Popular with backpackers, there's lots to do, such nature walks through the rainforest, trips down the Mekong, elephant rides, or visits to minority villages.

* **LuGuHu 泸沽湖**

  A massive lake, alongside which lives a minority population famous for their matriarchal society. Not much to do except relax, walk, hike, cycle, or take canoes out on the lake. It's a protected area, free from development, and there's a [¥100](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=100&From=CNY&To=GBP "See how much this is in £") fee for tourists.

* **HongDi 红地**

  An area North of Kunming famous for its red soil. Lots of terraced mountains, some nice scenery for trekking.

* **HeShun 和顺**

  Another old town similar to Dali and Lijiang, but not as big (and therefore, not as touristy).
